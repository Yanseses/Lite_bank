### Launch of the project:
In order to run a project on a local or virtual host, you need:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub to the desired folder.
2. In the folder, open the console (GitBash) and enter the command ` npm i ` - this will install all the necessary extensions.
3. After installing all the necessary extensions, we execute the ` npm build ` command - thereby building our project in Production mode.
4. After installing all the required extensions and building the project, run the local server via the command line ` npm start `.
5. Go to the local/virtual server and go to the /dist folder.
6. The following credentials are available for authorization:
	* Login: `developer`
	* password: `skillbox`

The backend generates artificial translations on one of the users, which allows you to track the correctness of the rendering of translation tables, as well as the generation of statistics tables.

**Please note:** By default, the local web server listens on port 3000.
